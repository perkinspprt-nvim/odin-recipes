    <h5>What is sushi rice ?</h5>
Sushi rice is less of a type of rice than it is a preparation method. It's cooked short-grain white rice combined with rice vinegar and other ingredients, cooled completely, and then used to make sushi rolls.

      <h5>What is the best rice for sushi ?</h5>
         The best rice for sushi is short-grain Japanese rice — this is what's in the bags labeled "sushi rice" at the store.

This glutinous rice has a higher starch content than other varieties, which gives it the sticky texture you're after when you make sushi.

      <h5>Seasoning for sushi rice ?</h5>
 Classic sushi rice is seasoned with just rice vinegar, white sugar, and salt. This recipe calls for vegetable oil instead of a bolder oil, so the simple seasonings have a chance to really shine.

        <h5>General Overview on How it's made.</h5>
        You can make sushi rice on the stove, in a rice cooker, or even in an Instant Pot. Our stovetop method is as easy as it gets. You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

Add the rinsed rice to a saucepan with water (use 3 parts water to 2 parts rice). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, covered, until the rice is tender and all the water has been absorbed.


Combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a separate saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.


Allow the vinegar mixture to cool, then stir it into the cooked rice. Stir until the rice is nice and sticky — it'll look wet at first, but it'll dry as it cools.       </p>

        <h4>Ingredients :</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 cups uncooked glutinous white rice (sushi rice)</li>
          <li>3 cups water</li>
          <li>½ cup rice vinegar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
          <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>


    <p>

      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <p>step 1 : 
         Gather all ingredients.  </p>

      <p>step 2:
        Rinse the rice in a strainer or colander under cold running water until the water runs clear.</p>


      <p>step 3:
        Combine rice and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and all water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from stove and set aside until cool enough to handle.</p>

      <p>step 4: 
        Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar has dissolved. Allow to cool, then stir into the cooked rice. While mixture will appear very wet at first, keep stirring and rice will dry as it cools. </p>
